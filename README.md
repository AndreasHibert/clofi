# clofi

clofi is a fork from [ytplay](https://github.com/raphtlw/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/ytplay).

since youtube-dl is not maintained anymore I changed this script to yt-dlp

I rewrote the script to my needs.

copy the file to `/usr/local/bin` and set a keybind in your WM to `clofi --audio`, and everytime you press your keybind the script will start playing the default or given youtube URL in the backgroud. Press again to kill mpv.
